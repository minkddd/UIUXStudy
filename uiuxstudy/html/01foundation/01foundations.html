            <h2>Intro - UX design</h2>
            <h3>What is User Experience Design?</h3>
            <p>
                The user experience is how a user feels about interaction with or experiencing a product. A product is a
                good, service, or feature. It might be a video game controller or a bag of potato chips, or a technology
                product, like an app, website, or smartwatch. <br>
                For user to have a good experience, the product needs to be <strong>usable, equitable, enjoyable, and
                    useful.</strong>
            <h4>Usable</h4>
            <p>If product is usable, it means the design, structure, and purpose of the product is clear and easy to
                use. As you evaluate a product for usability, <i>you can ask questions like:</i> Is everything in the
                design easy to find? Is the design’s functionality easy to understand? Can users accomplish specific
                tasks within the design?</p>
            <p class="memo"> : 제품의 디자인, 구조, 목적이 모두에게 명확할 것.</p>
            <h4>Equitable</h4>
            <p>If a product is equitable, it means a design is helpful to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds.
                In other words, the product’s design addresses the needs of a diverse audience and ensures a
                high-quality experience is delivered to all users regardless of background, gender, race, or ability. As
                you evaluate the equity of a product’s UX, <i>you can ask questions like:</i> Are the needs of a diverse
                group of users considered? Does the product’s design address the needs of traditionally underrepresented
                and excluded groups?</p>
            <p class="memo"> : 다양한 능력과 배경을 가진 사람들 모두에게 유용할 것.</p>
            <h4>Enjoyable</h4>
            <p>If a product is enjoyable, it means the design delights the user. The design reflects what the user may
                be thinking or feeling and creates a positive connection with them. An enjoyable design adds to an
                already functional product and can enhance the user’s feelings about the experience. As you evaluate how
                enjoyable a product’s UX is, <i>you can ask questions like:</i> Are there aspects of the design that
                consider the user’s feelings? Does the design inspire delight in the user? Does the design keep the user
                engaged throughout their experience?</p>
            <p class="memo"> : 유저와 제품 사이에 긍정적 관계 형성. 시각적 즐거움 주기.</p>
            <h4>Useful</h4>
            <p>If a product is useful, that means it solves user problems. In other words, the design intentionally
                solves a user problem that the designer has identified. Usability refers to the product working well and
                being easy to use, while usefulness refers directly to the ability to solve user problems. As you
                evaluate how useful a product’s UX is, <i>you can ask questions like:</i> Does the design add value to
                the user’s experience? Does the design solve a problem for the user? Does the design help the user
                achieve a specific goal?</p>

            </p>
            <h3>User Experience Career</h3>
            <h4>interaction designer</h4>
            <p>
                Interaction designers focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions. They strive
                to understand the user flow, or the path, that a typical user takes to complete a task on an app,
                website, or other platform. An interaction designer's work answers questions like: What should happen if
                a user taps on this button? How do we make this action easier for users to complete? And, how are the
                design elements within the website laid out? Interaction designers focus less on how the product looks
                and instead strive to make the product easy to navigate and simple for users to interact with.

                어떻게 배치될지 등(그래픽적인 부분은 덜 신경씀)</p>
            </p>
            <h4>visual designer</h4>
            <p>
                Visual designers focus on how a product or technology looks. They are often responsible for designing
                logos, illustrations, and icons, as well as deciding on font color, size, and placement. Visual
                designers focus on the layout of each page or screen and make all of the design elements fit together in
                a visually appealing way. The role of a visual designer is to answer questions like: What kind of visual
                style should icons have, in order to fit the product's branding? Or, which color and font should we use
                for this button? The goal of a visual designer is to delight users with designs that inspire, engage,
                and excite them.
            </p>
            <p class="memo"> : 비주얼적인 것에 집중. 브랜드에 맞게 로고, 일러스트, 아이콘, 폰트 컬러, 사이즈 등을 정하고 전체적인 레이아웃이 시각적으로 돋보이도록 설계한다.</p>
            <h4>motion designer</h4>
            <p>
                Motion designers think about what it feels like for a user to move through a product and how to create
                smooth transitions between pages on an app or website. They may also create animations or visual effects
                to bring their design ideas to life. A motion designer’s work answers questions like: How should an app
                transition between pages? How do we show the connection between these actions? And, what’s an engaging
                animation that will help tell our story? Motion designers focus on design elements that move, rather
                than traditional static designs.

            <h4>VR/AR designer</h4>
            <p>
                A VR or AR designer’s work answers questions like: How do we create a user experience that leverages 3D
                space? Or, will this action cause a user motion sickness? To ensure users are comfortable immersing in a
                VR or AR experience, designers need to carefully consider everything from sound to lighting.
            </p>
            <h4>UX Researcher</h4>
            <p>
                UX researchers conduct studies or interviews that examine how people use a product. UX researchers often
                identify pain points that users are experiencing and explore how products can help solve those problems.
                They also explore the usability of existing products, by asking users to complete tasks in an app or
                website, for example. UX researchers answer questions like: What problems are users facing? Is the
                design of this product easy to use? And, would people be interested in this new design feature? The goal
                of UX researchers is often to understand how a product can provide a solution to a real problem users
                are having.

            <h4>UX writer</h4>
            <p>
                UX writers think about how to make the language within a product clearer so that the user experience is
                more intuitive. UX writers also help define a brand’s voice and personality. The work of UX writers
                often includes writing labels for buttons and determining the tone of language used within an app or
                website. UX writers focus on answering questions like: What words should be used to communicate this
                idea clearly? Should the tone for this app be friendly or technical? And, what should the language on
                this button label say? UX writers often become subject matter experts in order to present content that’s
                easy to understand for all users.

            <h4>UX program manager</h4>
            <p>
                UX program managers ensure clear and timely communication, so that the process of building a useful
                product moves smoothly from start to finish. This might include setting goals, writing project plans,
                and allocating team resources.UX program managers answer questions like: What are the overall goals for
                this project, and what’s the plan to achieve them? And, how can we create and improve processes within
                the team? UX program managers work across departments to make sure that UX is involved throughout a
                project lifecycle.

            <h4>UX engineer</h4>
            <p>
                UX engineers translate the design’s intent into a functioning experience, like an app or a website. They
                help UX teams figure out if designs are intuitive and technically feasible. UX engineers answer
                questions like: How do we implement each interaction? How do we build this design in a way that stays
                true to its original intent? And, how might we explore alternatives to determine the best user
                experience? UX engineers synthesize design and development, bringing product concepts to life.
            </p>

            <h4>Conversation designer</h4>
            <p>
                Conversational interfaces are everywhere, from intelligent virtual assistants like Google Assistant and
                Siri, to interactive voice response systems like customer service systems you can talk to.
                Conversational interfaces even include automobile navigation systems and chatbots! Conversation design
                incorporates natural, real-world conversational behaviors into the interactions between users and these
                systems. Conversation designers make it possible for users to have natural conversations to get things
                done. They leverage user research, psychology, technical knowledge, and linguistics to create user
                experiences that are intuitive and engaging. Conversation designers develop the “persona” or personality
                of the voice, as well as the flow and dialog of the interaction. Conversation designers answer questions
                like: What’s the ideal language and flow based on who users are, the task to be accomplished, and the
                context of the conversation? Does the personality of the virtual assistant seem genuine, engaging, and
                reflective of the brand values? How does the conversation work with on-screen elements? Does the virtual
                assistant offer a consistent, usable, and useful experience end-to-end?
